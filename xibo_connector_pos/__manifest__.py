Xibo Connector — Point of Sale
==============================

AI Thank-You (with optional audio) + Dynamic Customer Display Mirror +
Contextual Recommendations for POS via Xibo CMS.

Changelog
---------
19.0.1.5.35 (2026-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Screens that never reacted now do.** Some players ignore a real-time
  layout change even though the CMS accepts it, and only ever play what is
  on their schedule — the cart mirror and the Thank-You message simply never
  appeared on those, with nothing in the log to explain it. Tick *Player
  Ignores Instant Changes* on the display (Xibo Connector) and this module
  schedules the content for exactly as long as it is shown, asks the player
  to collect, and clears the entry afterwards. Untouched screens keep using
  the instant push alone.
* Ending the cart mirror now also takes it off the schedule before reverting:
  on a schedule-only player, reverting to a schedule that still holds the
  mirror changed nothing.

19.0.1.5.34 (2026-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Thank-You message could be sent twice for one order.** Both
  ``create()`` and ``write(state=paid)`` schedule the broadcast, and the
  loser of that race took its database snapshot *before* the winner
  committed (Odoo cursors run in REPEATABLE READ), so it read the "already
  sent" flag as False, broadcast a second time and then died with
  ``could not serialize access due to concurrent update``. The background
  runner now works in READ COMMITTED and claims the order with a single
  atomic ``UPDATE ... WHERE NOT sent``, and re-saving an order that is
  already paid no longer schedules anything.
* **Layouts are built on the canvas of the screen they target** (Customer
  Display mirror and Recommendations), instead of always 1920x1080.
* **The Thank-You layout is now created and repaired automatically**, on
  the canvas of the target screen, with a *Rebuild for this screen* button
  in the settings. Previously it was built by hand: it was designed at
  1920x1080 whatever the screen was, and if somebody deleted it from the
  CMS the POS kept pointing at a dead id with nothing in the log to say so.
* **Saving the Xibo settings refreshes the POS.** Odoo's own
  ``last_data_change`` stamp only depends on native POS fields, so open POS
  tabs kept reading their cached copy of the Xibo settings and never called
  the server. The stamp is now moved forward when a setting the front-end
  reads changes.
* Fixed: the "mirror already active" flag lived in memory, so with several
  workers it depended on which process answered the request. It is stored
  in the database now, and expires by itself if a revert is ever lost.

19.0.1.5.33 (2026-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Privacy — optional access key on the Thank-You page**. The public
  ``/xibo/thanks/<id>`` endpoint was keyed only by a guessable integer, so
  anyone could read the last customer name + product. A per-POS secret key
  is now supported via ``?key=<token>``. Enforcement is **OFF by default**
  (``xibo_thanks_require_token``) so upgrading breaks nothing: update each
  screen's Webpage widget URL to the one shown in Settings (it includes the
  key), then turn the switch ON. Bad/missing key serves the neutral fallback
  page — never data, never an error.
* **Security — healthcheck closed by default**. ``/xibo/healthcheck`` no
  longer leaks module version, Xibo connectivity, AI availability or render
  counts to the public internet. It returns 404 unless the secret
  ir.config_parameter ``xibo_connector_pos.healthcheck_token`` is set and
  passed as ``?token=<secret>``.

19.0.1.5.31 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **New feature — optional audio notification on Thank-You**. Configurable
  per POS. Four built-in synthetic audio presets (chime / cash / success /
  bell, ~10-22KB each, royalty-free) plus a custom URL option for clients
  who want their own sound. Volume slider (0-100). The audio plays inside
  the Webpage widget's HTML5 ``<audio autoplay>`` element, perfectly synced
  with the visual animation.
* **Defensive schema validation via pre_init_hook**. When the module is
  upgraded in-place (just dropping new files and restarting Odoo, without
  going through Apps -> Upgrade), the new Python code expects columns that
  Odoo hasn't created yet, causing ``UndefinedColumn`` errors on the next
  sale. The pre_init_hook now runs ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS``
  for every field the latest version declares on ``pos_order`` and
  ``pos_config``. Fully idempotent; safe to run repeatedly.
* **Migration script for v1.5.31**. ``migrations/19.0.1.5.31/post-migration.py``
  normalises the new audio fields on existing pos.config rows (default
  audio_enabled=False so no surprise sounds for upgraders, audio_preset='chime',
  audio_volume=80).
* **New endpoint — /xibo/healthcheck**. Returns a JSON diagnostic showing
  schema integrity, Xibo server connectivity, AI agent availability, and
  active render count. Useful for monitoring tools and customer support.
* **Renamed admin preview endpoint**. The old ``/xibo/thanks/<id>/preview``
  is now ``/xibo/thanks/<id>/admin-preview`` to prevent the
  most-common-customer-misconfiguration: pasting the admin preview URL
  into the Xibo Webpage widget (which then redirected the player to a
  login page). The old ``/preview`` URL still works as a deprecated alias
  but logs a warning so admins notice.
* **Friendly error pages**. Controller catches exceptions and serves a
  branded HTML fallback instead of a raw Werkzeug traceback. The fallback
  message stays generic in production to avoid leaking implementation
  details.

19.0.1.5.30 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Critical bugfix — v1.5.29's up-front flag set blocked itself**. The
  v1.5.29 fix set ``xibo_thanks_sent=TRUE`` via raw SQL BEFORE calling
  ``_xibo_send_thanks``. But that method's first check is "if
  xibo_thanks_sent: skip" — which now ALWAYS triggered because we just
  set it ourselves. Net effect: NOTHING ever happened on Thank-You.
  Orders ended with the flag True but no AI message, no render, no XMR.
  Fix: the runner now passes ``xibo_skip_sent_check=True`` in the
  context when calling ``_xibo_send_thanks``, and that check is
  conditional on the absence of that context flag.

19.0.1.5.29 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Critical bugfix — race condition allowed the second thread to do
  the work twice**. The previous v1.5.28 lock acquired correctly, but
  the dedup flag (``xibo_thanks_sent``) was only set AFTER the
  Thank-You broadcast completed inside ``_xibo_send_thanks`` — too
  late: the second thread woke up from the lock, re-read the flag,
  saw False (because the flag was set via ORM ``write()`` deferred to
  commit time), and proceeded to do all the work again, fighting with
  the first thread's AI server action over the same row. Result: PG
  ``could not serialize access`` and a second render published over
  the first one. Fix: the runner now writes the flag via raw SQL
  ``UPDATE pos_order SET xibo_thanks_sent=TRUE WHERE id=%s`` BEFORE
  doing any work. The other thread wakes up and sees the new flag
  immediately. No more double-firing.

19.0.1.5.28 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Critical bugfix — preset HTML rendering crashed with KeyError 'margin'**.
  The preset templates contain inline CSS rules like ``body{margin:0}``
  whose curly braces collided with Python's ``str.format()`` placeholder
  syntax, raising ``KeyError`` on the very first CSS rule. The endpoint
  silently fell back to the "Gracias por su visita" neutral page on
  every request. Replaced ``.format()`` with direct ``.replace()`` of
  named tokens — CSS curly braces are now left intact.
* **Critical bugfix — race condition crash on every Thank-You sale**.
  The dedup ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` was triggering PostgreSQL
  ``could not serialize access due to concurrent update`` under
  REPEATABLE READ isolation (Odoo's default). The race protection still
  worked (the Thank-You only fired once) but the log showed a scary
  ERROR after every sale. Replaced with ``pg_advisory_xact_lock`` — a
  lightweight, isolation-friendly lock keyed on the order id, namespaced
  to avoid collisions with core Odoo or other modules.

19.0.1.5.27 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Major rework — URL-render flow replaces DataSet for AI Thank-You**.

  Previous versions pushed the AI-generated message into a Xibo DataSet
  and let the player's ticker widget read from it. In practice this never
  worked reliably: the player caches DataSets and refreshes them only
  every N minutes (the smallest interval is too long for a real-time
  Thank-You). The on-screen message lagged minutes behind the actual sale.

  The new architecture removes the DataSet from the path entirely:

  1. When an order is paid, the connector creates a record in a new
     ``xibo.thanks.render`` table holding the message body, customer name,
     top product, total, and chosen visual preset.
  2. An XMR ``changeLayout`` switches the target screens to the Thank-You
     Layout, which contains a single ``Webpage`` widget pointing at
     ``/xibo/thanks/<config_id>`` on this server.
  3. The Webpage widget reloads on every layout activation. The endpoint
     responds with ``Cache-Control: no-cache`` and serves a fresh HTML
     page rendered from the most recent ``xibo.thanks.render`` record.

  Result: the on-screen message ALWAYS matches the sale that just
  happened. No more cache lag, no more stale messages.

* **Three built-in visual presets** for instant deployment:

  * ``Minimal`` — clean, lots of whitespace, animated check mark,
    soft fade-in. Default.
  * ``Warm`` — jewelry-friendly, gold accents, serif typography,
    ornament glyph, soft bloom animation.
  * ``Bold`` — high contrast, big text, energetic slide-in,
    cinema-like background pulse.

  All presets are 1920×1080 native with fluid units for any aspect ratio.
  All are pure CSS — no external fonts, no JS, no CDN — so they render
  even when the Xibo player has limited connectivity beyond the Odoo
  server it's already reaching.

* **Custom HTML preset** for full creative control. The cashier pastes
  their own HTML/CSS and references dynamic values via simple
  placeholders: ``{{message}}``, ``{{customer_name}}``, ``{{top_product}}``,
  ``{{product_image_url}}``, ``{{total}}``, ``{{currency}}``,
  ``{{company_name}}``, ``{{company_logo_url}}``.

* **Optional product image**: a single boolean
  (``xibo_thanks_show_product_image``) toggles a photo of the most
  expensive product in the order. The image is served as
  ``/web/image/product.product/<id>/image_1024`` so it goes straight from
  Odoo's Media library to the screen.

* **Admin preview endpoint** at ``/xibo/thanks/<config_id>/preview`` (auth
  required). Renders the chosen preset with sample data so admins can
  fine-tune their Custom HTML without making a sale.

* **GC cron**: ``xibo.thanks.render`` records older than 1 hour past
  expiry are purged every 30 minutes. Lightweight, single indexed query.

* **Legacy compatibility**: the old ``xibo_thanks_dataset_id`` field is
  preserved but marked deprecated; it is still used by the Camino A
  (Broadcast) fallback path for setups without target screens.

19.0.1.5.26 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Provider-agnostic AI via the native Odoo ``ai_computed`` server action
  mechanism. Works with whichever LLM provider the customer has
  configured (OpenAI today, future providers automatically).

19.0.1.5.25 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Anti-double-dispatch race condition guard via ``SELECT FOR UPDATE`` on
  the order row.

19.0.1.5.24 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Thread launched on post-commit, not inside the current transaction.

19.0.1.5.23 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Diagnostic instrumentation across the Thank-You pipeline.

19.0.1.5.22 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Critical bugfix: removed obsolete ``Environment.manage()`` call.

19.0.1.5.21 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* AI Thank-You direct XMR (deprecated approach, kept for transition).

19.0.1.5.20 (2026-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Customer Display Mirror end-to-end with real-time cart sync via shared
  ``device_uuid`` in the websocket bus.
* In-memory ``_xibo_mirror_active`` deduplicates XMR calls on every product add.
