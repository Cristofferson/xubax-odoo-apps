POS Down Payment Discount on the Sale Order
===========================================
When the cashier pays part of a sale order at the Point of Sale (down payment) and gives
the customer a discount on that line, Odoo only lowers what the ticket charges: the
sale order keeps its full price and shows a balance the customer never owed.

This module gives the sale order the same discount, at the moment the ticket is
synced: a "POS discount (ticket ...)" line made with the Sales discount wizard (fixed
amount, taxes included), plus a note in the order's chatter. Each POS line is carried
only once, even if the POS sends the ticket again.

Works with any localization and any tax setup (the discount keeps the taxes of the
order). No configuration.
