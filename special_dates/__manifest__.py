Special Dates
=============

Track and celebrate every important date of your customers and contacts:
birthdays, anniversaries, contract renewals, festivals and any custom
recurring event. Reminders live inside the **Contacts** app and trigger
celebratory popups directly in the **Point of Sale** so your team never
misses an opportunity to delight a customer.

Key features
------------
* Unlimited reminder types (Birthday, Anniversary, Renewal, ...).
* Recurrence by day of the week, every N days or every year.
* Multi-channel communication schedule per Reminder Type:
  send an Email N days before, an SMS the day before, etc.
* WhatsApp channel available via the optional add-on
  ``special_dates_whatsapp`` (auto-installed when both ``special_dates``

  ``mail.activity`` type on the responsible user when the date arrives,
  with native Odoo notifications.
